This HTML code creates a simple web page for an SVG Freehand Drawing Tool. It includes:
A container with a heading (SVG Drawing Tool).
An SVG element (<svg id="drawingArea">) where drawings will be made.
A linked CSS file (style.css) for styling and a JavaScript file (script.js) for handling the drawing functionality.
The HTML only sets up the structure; the actual drawing behavior is implemented in script.js.
 
 HTML (Structure):

The HTML file creates the layout of the drawing tool.
A container holds the drawing tool area.
Inside it, there is a heading "SVG Drawing Tool".
An <svg> element is used as the drawing area where users can draw with the mouse.
HTML here is only responsible for showing the structure of the page (title, heading, and drawing area).

CSS (Styling):

The CSS styles the page and drawing area.
The body uses a simple font style.
The container has a border, fixed width, and padding to neatly hold the drawing tool.
The SVG drawing area has its own border, light background color, fixed size (560Ã—400 pixels), and a crosshair cursor so users know they can draw there.
CSS is only responsible for the look and layout of the tool.

JavaScript (Functionality):

JavaScript makes the drawing tool work.
It detects mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup).
When the user presses the mouse (mousedown), drawing starts, and a new SVG path is created.
As the mouse moves (mousemove), new line segments are added to the path, making it look like freehand drawing.
When the mouse is released (mouseup), drawing stops.
JavaScript is responsible for the interactive behavior of drawing inside the SVG area.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:-
Understanding HTML structure for SVG graphics.
Linking CSS and JavaScript to HTML for styling and interactivity.
Using SVG as a drawing surface instead of <canvas>.
Handling mouse events in JavaScript for interactivity.
