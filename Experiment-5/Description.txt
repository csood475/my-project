HTML (Structure):

HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage. In this project, HTML is used to make:
A heading for the product list.
A dropdown menu where the user can select a category (All, Clothing, Electronics, Books).
A list of products, each product has a category assigned to it.
HTML is only responsible for showing the content on the page.

<!DOCTYPE html>: Tells the browser the page uses HTML5.
<html lang="en">: Sets the page language to English.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Ensures correct text encoding (supports all characters).
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Makes the page responsive on all devices.
<title>Product Filter</title>: Title of the webpage shown in the browser tab.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">: Links an external CSS file for styling.
<div class="product-box">: A container for all content.
<h2>: Displays the heading "Product List".
<label>: Describes the dropdown for accessibility.
<select>: A dropdown menu for filtering products by category.
id="category1": Unique ID for JavaScript to target.
Options:
"all" → Show all products
"clothing", "electronics", "books" → Show specific category products.
<div id="products1" class="product-list">: Container for all products.
Each product:
Uses <div class="product" data-category="...">.
data-category is a custom HTML attribute storing the category (used in JavaScript for filtering).
Example: "T-Shirt" → data-category="clothing".
Links to an external JavaScript file (script.js) that will:
Detect changes in the dropdown.
Show/hide products based on the selected category.

CSS (Styling):
CSS is used to make the webpage look good. In this project, CSS is used to:
Set background color and font style of the page.
Add borders, padding, and spacing to the product box.
Style the dropdown menu and labels.
Give each product a neat box design with border, padding, margin, and rounded corners.
CSS is only responsible for the design and appearance.

JavaScript (Functionality):

JavaScript is used to add interactivity. In this project, JavaScript:
Reads the dropdown menu selection.
Checks each product’s category.
If the product matches the selected category, it is shown; otherwise, it is hidden.
If "All" is selected, then all products are displayed.
JavaScript is responsible for behavior and making the filter work.
